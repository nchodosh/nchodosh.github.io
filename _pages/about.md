I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computing Sciences at Villanova University. My research focuses on computer vision , and specifically on autonomous driving and LiDAR-based sensing. I am particularly interested in analysis by synthesis, the machine learning approach wherein inferences are made by comparing hypothetical world-states produced by a world-model to actual measurements. My work has been published at venues including <a href='https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/html/Chodosh_When_to_Use_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Inverse_Problems_CVPR_2020_paper.html'>CVPR</a>, <a href='https://vedder.io/zeroflow.html'>ICLR</a>, <a href='https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2024/html/Chodosh_Re-Evaluating_LiDAR_Scene_Flow_WACV_2024_paper.html'>WACV</a>, <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13896'>3DV</a>, and <a href='https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-20887-5_31'>ACCV</a>.

I received my PhD from the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by <a  href='https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/simon.lucey'>Simon Lucey</a> and <a href='https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~deva/'>Deva Ramanan</a>. Prior to that, I received my BSE from the University of Pennsylvania, where I worked with <a href='https://www.kumarrobotics.org/'>Vijay Kumar</a> and <a href='https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jshi/'>Jianbo Shi</a>. I have also been lucky enough to collaborate on research with Argo AI (now <a href='https://lat.ai/'>Latitutde AI</a>) and the <a href='https://www.mlb.com/pirates'>Pittsburgh Pirates</a>.
