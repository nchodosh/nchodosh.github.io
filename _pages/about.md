I am an Assistant Professor at Villanova University in the Computing Sciences department where I teach and research computer vision. My interested in computer vision began while completing my undergraduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania. There, I worked in the lab's of Vijay Kumar and Jianbo Shi on automatic methods for detecting and tracking microrobots for the purpose of optical control. I then began my Ph.D. in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon working first under Simon Lucey and then Deva Ramanan. During my Ph.D. I became interested analysis by synthesis; the machine learning approach where inferences are made by comparing hypothetical world-states produced by a world-model to actual measurements. This idea became the foundation of my thesis in which I applied it to my main practical area of interest: autonomous driving and more specifically LiDAR-based sensing. My interest in LiDAR came from my work for Argo AI (now Latitude AI) a Pittsburgh-based autonomous driving company. I have published on various aspects of LiDAR-based sensing including depth completion, scene flow, and scene reconstruction.
