I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computing Sciences at Villanova University. My research focuses on computer vision , and specifically on autonomous driving and LiDAR-based sensing. I am particularly interested in applying analysis by synthesis, the machine learning approach wherein inferences are made by comparing hypothetical world-states produced by a world-model to actual measurements, to computer vision problems. My work has been published at venues including CVPR, ICLR, WACV, 3DV, and ACCV.

I received my PhD from the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by Simon Lucey and Deva Ramanan. Prior to that, I received my BSE from the University of Pennsylvania, where I worked with Vijay Kumar and Jianbo Shi. I have also been lucky enough to collaborate on research with Argo AI (now Latitutde AI) and the Pittsburgh Pirates.
